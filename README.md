# Old-2022-Portfolio
This portfolio was a required project for my Careerline Tech Center class using HTML5 and CSS3. We were given a template to modify for this project; however, I decided to make my own design and create most of the visual elements myself. Information on the page is outdated and I currently don't have a portfolio due to time constraints at the moment, but am slowly working on creating another one.
